# walmart_executive_dashboard_tableau
In this project I use Tableau to build an interactive executive dashboard for Walmart. 
The sample data I used is uploaded above and the link to the dashboard is below:

Dashboard Walkthrough: 

(Read this walkthrough guide as you interact with the dashboard)

I first want to draw your attention to the middle right of the dashboard, where we have the Walmart logo. 
  -	In this section we first have a region filter, by selecting a region, the user can see data specific to that region. All   the data on the change to match the region selected. 
  -	Then we have a profit ratio filter, this allows the user to filter states/provinces and regions by their profit ratio.    As one moves the slider, all the data in the dashboard will change to only display the data from regions and                states/provinces which are in the range. 
  -	For example, if you move the left slider to 0.0%, this will allow you to see all the states/provinces and regions that    have a positive profit ratio. Other corresponding information will also change, such as the Sales, Profits, Sales by        Sub-Category, and the Key Performance Indicators. 
  -	We also have a date filter; this allows a user to see the data in a particular time frame. For example, if you moved      the right slider to December 31st, 2014, you would see only information for 2014. 
  -	Finally, below the date filter we have a legend indicating to the user what the colors mean on the map. 
  
I now want to draw your attention to the map at the center of the dashboard. When a person clicks on a state/province, the entire dashboard changes its data to display the corresponding information of that state/province. You will also notice that the name of the graphs on the bottom and the title of the dashboard changes from ‘All’ to the corresponding state/province picked. If you hover over a province/state, you will be able to see its profit ratio plus a list of the subcategories and their profit ratios.

Then on the left of the map, we have a pie chart which breaks down each sub-category by sales. This pie chart changes as filters are applied or a specific state/province is selected. 

Above the center, we have the key performance indicators. These change as filters are applied or a specific state/province is selected. 

At the bottom we have two graphs. On the left we have total sales and on the right, we have total profits, both show values year over year, broken down by the fiscal quarter. If you hover over the bar graph, you can also see the data for the corresponding month. 

For example, if you hover the last bar in 2014, the top the bar is October, the middle is November, and the bottom is December. The height of the individual months is related to the number of sales in the month. As you can see, November is the biggest section of the bar as it has the most sales. All the bars in the both the graphs are broken down in this manner. 

Overall, this dashboard is very versatile and can manage many filter combinations. Put yourself in the shoes of an executive managing Walmart and see what information you can harness from the dashboard.
