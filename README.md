# walmart_executive_dashboard_tableau
In this project, I utilized Tableau to construct an interactive executive dashboard specifically for Walmart. The uploaded sample data is accessible above and the corresponding dashboard link can be accessed below:

Allow me to walk you through the dashboard, which I've designed for easy user navigation and maximum data interpretation.

(Read this while going through the dashboard)

Let's begin by examining the middle right section of the dashboard, where you will find the Walmart logo.

Here, we have a region filter that permits users to view data pertaining to a specific region. Upon selection of a region, all data will adjust accordingly. Following that, we have a profit ratio filter that allows users to filter states/provinces and regions by their profit ratio. Upon moving the slider, the dashboard will present data only from regions and states/provinces within the designated range. For instance, if you adjust the left slider to 0.0%, you will see all the states/provinces and regions that have a positive profit ratio, along with other corresponding information such as Sales, Profits, Sales by Sub-Category, and the Key Performance Indicators. Additionally, we have a date filter that enables users to view data within a specific time frame. If you move the right slider to December 31st, 2014, for example, you will only see information for 2014. Lastly, beneath the date filter, we have a legend that explains the colors on the map to the user.

Now let's focus on the map in the center of the dashboard. If you click on a state/province, the dashboard will adjust to display the corresponding information for that state/province. Furthermore, you will notice that the name of the graphs on the bottom and the title of the dashboard will change from 'All' to the selected state/province. Hovering over a province/state will provide you with the profit ratio of that location, along with a list of the subcategories and their respective profit ratios.

To the left of the map, we have a pie chart that illustrates the breakdown of each sub-category by sales. This pie chart will change according to the selected filters or state/province.

Above the center, we have the key performance indicators which adapt to the applied filters or selected state/province.

At the bottom of the dashboard, you'll see two graphs. The left graph presents total sales, while the right shows total profits, both depicted year over year and broken down by fiscal quarter. Hovering over the bar graph will reveal the data for the corresponding month. For example, if you hover over the last bar in 2014, the top of the bar represents October, the middle is November, and the bottom is December. The height of the individual months reflects the number of sales in that month. As you can observe, November has the most sales, resulting in the largest section of the bar. All the bars in both graphs are organized in the same manner.

Overall, this dashboard is highly versatile and can accommodate numerous filter combinations. As an executive managing Walmart, the dashboard provides an abundance of valuable information. I encourage you to explore and utilize this dashboard to its fullest potential.
